# Learning CTFs
A list of online 24/7 CTFs and CTF-like sites and VMs that are great for learning and training.

## Multiple
[Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/): Rolling boxes of varying difficulties. You will need to "hack" the login page to get the invite code.

[Cysca](https://cyberchallenge.com.au/): The Australian Cyber Challenge for uni students. Past challenges are available for download. Many challenge types. Ranges from easy to impossible.

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/): A CTF for high schoolers. Challenges start off quite easy and hints are pretty good. Runs for a month every year, and the challenges stay up for a year.

[Exploit Education](https://exploit.education/): Multiple VMs, though I've only attempted the early levels of Protostar, an intro to binary exploitation box.

## Misc
